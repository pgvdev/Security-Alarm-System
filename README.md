IoT Security System with Arduino  
Components Used: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Buzzer, IR Remote, IR Receiver, Breadboard, Servo Motor, Wires, LCD Display  

## üìå Overview  
A smart security system integrating IoT components to detect intrusions, manage access via IR remote, and provide real-time feedback through an LCD and buzzer.  

## üõ† Features  
- Motion Detection: Ultrasonic sensor triggers alerts for objects within 10 cm.  
- IR Remote Control: Lock/unlock system or set passwords using a remote.  
- LCD Feedback: Displays status messages (e.g., "Access Denied", "Motion Detected").  
- Buzzer Alerts: Audible alarms during intrusions or invalid access attempts.  
- Servo Motor Lock: Physical lock mechanism (90¬∞ = LOCKED, 0¬∞ = UNLOCKED).  
- Breadboard Setup: Organized wiring for easy replication.
